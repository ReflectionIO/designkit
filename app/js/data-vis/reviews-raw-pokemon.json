You encounter familiar characters in the open world and it even gives us an incentive to go out and get some exercise. As a game, it's done far more than any other mobile game has done; it's helped us become more social, I've seen more people join up and play the game together than ever.\n\nAs someone who has played the original handheld games from Nintendo, I've found it to be a pleasant change. The new mechanics are easy to learn, and the gameplay stays largely faithful to the original material. It's something that both newcomers to the franchise and veteran players can enjoy. Barring from the very occasional login glitch, it's been a great experience as a whole.\n\nSo why the 2-star rating then? Well, there's the other side of the story.\n\n---\n\nApple Watch Review: 0/5\n\nThe experience on the Apple Watch is completely different, for the worse. For one, the game is the most unstable app I have ever had the displeasure to test. I open the app, start a play session, then check the device again after a while to find that ten times out of ten the app has crashed back to the watch screen, erasing all play progress up to that point. I have never finished a single play session that did not involve force-crashing and loss of data. And that's when the app can be launched properly in the first place.\n\nUsually when opening the app on Apple Watch one of three things can happen - either the app stays on the loading screen perpetually until the watch auto-sleeps (whereby it crashes back to the Home Screen upon wake), the app launches but fails to sync my data and displays a blank profile, or very occasionally it launches normally and loads my profile only to crash mid-gameplay. Crashing on the Apple Watch will also carry over to the iPhone, if I have the game running on both devices and it crashes on my watch, the process will also be forcilby terminated on the iPhone and any progress will be lost.\n\nThis issue can be replicated on a newly restored Apple Watch running on stock settings, and appears to be due to coding issues and not because of system resource limitations. It's very clear that Pok\u00e9mon GO for the Apple Watch was rushed in development to make it in time for the iPhone 7 launch keynote appearance, and rushed once again for release in the 2016 holiday season. Without proper stability testing, the users are now paying the price for a rushed product.\n\n---\n\nOverall Rating: 2/5\n\nPok\u00e9mon GO is a great idea to begin with. It helps us be more active, more social, and is generally a very enjoyable game in itself. Sadly, this is hampered by serious performance and stability issues that ruin the gameplay and interrupt the positive experience with frustration. If you want a social game that can be enjoyed by everyone, both novice and experienced in Pok\u00e9mon, then look no further. However if you want to play on the go with the Apple Watch, give this a miss - it's not worth the frustration.\n\n---\n\nTested on:\niPhone 7 (iOS 10.2.1)\nApple Watch (WatchOS 3.1.3)", "rating": "2", "version": "1.27.2", "date": "2017-02-19T07:34:00-07:00", "title": "It's a Love-Hate Relationship."}, {"content": "All in all I think with the release of generation 2 of Pokemon the game has been saved.\nThings I don't understand!\n1: why didn't you increase the Pok\u00e9mon storage by around 100 to account for the new Pok\u00e9mon?\n2: why (still) have we still not got the full 151 of Pok\u00e9mon and other legendaries as well?\n\nDon't get me wrong the game is better now and a lot of people are satisfied me being among them but with the major delay on legendaries and trading features the public would like a little more insight into why these features haven't been released. \n\nGood game tho anyone can and should play.", "rating": "4", "version": "1.27.2", "date": "2017-02-19T07:28:00-07:00", "title": "Good but!?"}, {"content": "Since the new update the game wont let me load on!!
