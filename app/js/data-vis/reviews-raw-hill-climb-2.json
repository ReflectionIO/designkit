You seem to be rewarded not for great driving but instead for logging in every 8 hours and claiming a prize, watching a video and claiming a prize or just slogging through levels with no sense of fun at all. The gameplay seems dominated by the developers designing it all around making money which has definitely spoilt a potentially phenomenal game. It's still good but it feels commercial and unoriginal.
