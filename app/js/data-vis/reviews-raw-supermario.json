Ended up paying \u00a32.00 for the game, which is still overpriced! Last mistake I make in 2017, no Switch for me! =P\n\nI have played all the world and I must admit the first two worlds were good, after that ...the game felt rushed, like they ran out of ideas. The levels just kept getting shorter, less challenging and dull.\n\nWhen I finished all the worlds I was expecting a nice Mario ending ...well I did worked hard to finish the game like collecting all the coins etc etc ....and what I got was nothing ...it was like heres Peach, Game Over!!! Great!!\n\nThe Rally mode is the Vs. mode where you play against over players or do you?? anyways if you like Rally mode you will never be short of tickets to play the game. I have all the special blocks and while I have 99 (which is the max) tickets ...I just get more from the blocks every few hours.\n\nYou can also build up your kingdom, it not really my thing \u2026so I will not go into it. But if you do make the mistake and buy the game you will not be short on coins or Rally tickets so you can pretty much buy everything and play what ever you want.\n\nAfter you complete the game and have x amount of things there will be special levels available which are hard as....is this the challenge I was looking for NO, it stupid like MK8 200cc stupid!\n\nAnyways I really hope Nintendo don't make any more games like this...its a budget game with a now huge corporate price tag. People who don't mind paying this price \u2026all I can say is well since you have deep pockets fell free and send me some of you hard earned cash! =) ..oh, whats that I hear, yeah I though so!!!", "rating": "1", "version": "1.1.0", "date": "2017-02-01T12:32:00-07:00", "title": "Well I tied to play this with one hand on my iPad, but couldn't??"}, {"content": "When I bought this I was gobsmacked.

You can learn to live with this, but I just got a lag that meant I was exited out of the Rally after a win - and when I opened the app again, I found it stole some of the toad people because I exited out of Rally (I didn\u2019t, I was frozen out). \n\nGenerally, this game is fine - but I\u2019ve been playing on the unpaid version trying to decide whether to purchase it or not.

I also can't stop getting rally tickets from the '?' Surprise boxes. Of which I now have 4! I have stopped playing after world 3 to trying and give myself a chance to battle the Rally tickets down as I'm permanently on 99! \n\nMoral of the story and my only advice to anyone readying this and anyone who has played the first 3 levels and enjoyed it, I know it's very expensive. But pay the \u00a37.99. It will give you months of fun, and will be worth it. \u00a37.99 for months of happiness isn't much in the grand scheme of things. Plus it is a one off payment. All future levels will be free as they say 'pay to unlock ALL levels' so would be cheeky to throw in more in app purchases later. \n\nI hope this review really helps people make up their mind and take the jump. \n\nWhat a sensational game!! \ud83d\ude0e", "rating": "5", "version": "1.0.2", "date": "2017-01-08T10:41:00-07:00", "title": "Disappointed to begin with, however very impressed after purchase!"}, {"content": "For all the advertisements of this game it is no way near as good you have to pay a lot of money that is not very good", "rating": "1", "version": "1.0.2", "date": "2017-01-08T10:11:00-07:00", "title": "Not as good as advertised"}, {"content": "Slick design and quality development make this a game which evokes the real Mario experience.

What on earth are Nintendo thinking charging that much money for a few more levels!!! However after complaining a little I did purchase the game, but it took me about 15 mins to complete.\n\nI think that this game also needs a better control system, I didn't expect a control system as awful as this. Mario will automatically run, which is VERY annoying because sometimes you need to go back because you missed one of the pink coins, I understand why Mario automatically runs, but I think that more thought should've gone into this.\n\nThe kingdom builder is ok, but I really don't see the point in it. However I do like the idea of it as it gives you something else to do instead of endlessly trying to beat other people in the toad rally mode. \n\nToad rally is quite fun, but annoying because of the mechanics. Two complaints I have is why on earth you need the rally tickets. That is something I did not imagine requiring beyond my wildest dreams. Also the coin rush is something that really is not explained very well and really confused me when that first happened.\n\nThe last thing I had a problem with is the bowser boss battles. I think because of the mechanics, it's quite hard to create a boss battle that works easy with the game mechanics. It took me at least 4 attempts to clear the bowser castles.\n\nFinally,\nI have one thing to say about this game that is good, the graphics.

There are no mechanics except jump, and spin (while in midair,) meaning you have no way of going back to correct mistakes. You don't actually control mario - all you can do is jump. Furthermore, after about 2 minutes i had completed the first set of levels, and clicked on the next one, foolishly hoping i might be able to actually play the game. But no. You can't even play past the first couple of levels without paying, which frankly is awful.
