You can learn to live with this, but I just got a lag that meant I was exited out of the Rally after a win - and when I opened the app again, I found it stole some of the toad people because I exited out of Rally (I didn\u2019t, I was frozen out). \n\nGenerally, this game is fine - but I\u2019ve been playing on the unpaid version trying to decide whether to purchase it or not.

From the time I downloaded him onto my precious iPhone and game device of choice these days, I was hooked! I played for hours, which is not unusual for a Super MARIO Bros game! I quickly completed the first three levels and decided \u00a37.99 was a worthy investment for some nostalgic game play. \nBut! And this is the kicker guys....As others have said the game is repetitive, very rapidly completed (no I haven't collected all the purple and black coins but I have most of them) I have however always got a full house of rally tokens (Max is 99) they are easy enough to obtain if you get all the coins from each level and then from reward boxes and game houses in your kingdom. \nI enjoy many a rally against other opponents but have quickly learned that only the flying ship level is worth completing and most of the time I win (which really does get tedious) \nI enjoyed working through these though and collecting toads to progress my kingdom, which again I raced through. To my utter disappointment come level 20 that is it! No more kingdom upgrades available, and therefore no real need to continue with the rally mode as I now have no need for toads except to unlock princes peaches special house, as I've run out of room in my kingdom now it just seems a pointless exercise. \nAfter doing some research it would seem that even though those big guys in Nintendo took \u00a37.99 from each of us for this promising game, they have failed to deliver.

And I must say. What a phenomonal game. I've been hooked since! The game just gets better and better. I have got over 2000 toads now and unlocked 4 islands. I also can't stop getting rally tickets from the '?' Surprise boxes. Of which I now have 4! I have stopped playing after world 3 to trying and give myself a chance to battle the Rally tickets down as I'm permanently on 99! \n\nMoral of the story and my only advice to anyone readying this and anyone who has played the first 3 levels and enjoyed it, I know it's very expensive. But pay the \u00a37.99. It will give you months of fun, and will be worth it. \u00a37.99 for months of happiness isn't much in the grand scheme of things. Plus it is a one off payment. All future levels will be free as they say 'pay to unlock ALL levels' so would be cheeky to throw in more in app purchases later. \n\nI hope this review really helps people make up their mind and take the jump. \n\nWhat a sensational game!! \ud83d\ude0e", "rating": "5", "version": "1.0.2", "date": "2017-01-08T10:41:00-07:00", "title": "Disappointed to begin with, however very impressed after purchase!"}, {"content": "For all the advertisements of this game it is no way near as good you have to pay a lot of money that is not very good", "rating": "1", "version": "1.0.2", "date": "2017-01-08T10:11:00-07:00", "title": "Not as good as advertised"}, {"content": "Slick design and quality development make this a game which evokes the real Mario experience.
