The options you have available are great even at this early stage to play around with. However, and you were expect this right.......\nI have spent money on the game to get tokens so I could buy players. The downside is the cost of players in relation to the tokens you need as a-posed to how many you gain from signing sponsor deals. Watching the free videos to receive free rests etc are not consistent and then there is the bonuses you accrue for player training. The maximum is 10% which decreases by 2% everyday and unless you are spending money daily it's often difficult to maintain at 6 to 8%. \nIn conclusion, the game is great, pick it up, train, plan and organise your team, the ground, excellent but don't take my word for it.

I played the game for 9 seasons, winning 9 consecutive league titles and 5 champions league trophies, while coming close in cups against people up to 3 divisions higher. With a bit of time and effort such as doing some free offers and watching videos you could have decent team. I was able to sign top players with some of the old free offers for 80 odd tokens but each season it got progressively worse, they removed the free 1 token browse offer and reduced the payouts of the ones mentioned above. By the time the 10th season came all of the 'free' offers required money and credit card details. It breaks my heart to see a game like this go down the money and greed route, with free players who put actual time and effort in losing out. After missing out on around 30 players on the transfer market in the first week of season 10, with all the other bidders having large token numbers probably from money.

The latest updates have vastly improved the game for a player like me who is loathe to spend money.

I've won the last two leagues. The cup and Champions League are a different matter though (hence 4 not 5 stars) as I've been matched with far superior teams. \n\nIt is frustrating when coins don't come through from offers but generally this game is an excellent football management game. \n\nFORMER REVIEW\n\nIt's a shame. This is a good game: lots to do, interesting, addictive, good gameplay. BUT. Since the last upgrade there's been a shift. The emphasis is now on the tokens (the game's currency) more than ever. You lose fitness and motivation far too quickly and often. If you hit a couple of losses, you're pretty much doomed unless you buy tokens to buy motivation and fitness chips. Rip off. A really good game spoiled by the greed of the developers.

This didn't happen when my team was slightly better than average.\nNordeus won't be getting another penny out of me. Sadly the game is flawed and you are better off playing the game for free and not investing money in it.
