There is no need, and messenger is doing the exact same thing. \nWhat is the point?? \nNo one wants their Facebook messages to be like snapchat, they'd use snapchat for that! Just give us plain and simple messaging like it used to be! The simple purpose of messenger was to send messages of text instantly, why complicate something that was already working perfectly, and change it into something it doesn't need to be! \nThere is no demand for messenger to be like snapchat, so please return to the previous format of actual messages, or you will continue to get 1 star reviews from irritated users like me. \nAlso the current photos (as of 10th January 2017) aren't the same as the new app, my advice is don't update or download the new version!
