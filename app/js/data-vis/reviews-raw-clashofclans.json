Also, for clans it would be good if you could create a feature where you could write notes for the clan and save them like sticky notes, so when you open up the clan screen you can see what a leader or co-leader has written in a Notes section, as a better form of leading and a way of getting a message across to the clan when you're not online. Another great feature would be to customise clan titles to make the clan more personal, and to assign different permissions for each of those titles e.g Kick Members, Recruit, Initiate a Clan War Search, Send a Clan Mail or something like that.

We love being involved in the wars but there is just one small problem. The clan seem to rely on the highest members to donate to all war bases and also to donate to each member when they use 2 attacks in every war. The problem with this is the top members are using a lot of elixir to train troops to make the war bases as strong as possible in defence. Therefore they aren't really gaining anything from each war, in most cases they are coming out with less elixir than what they started with. I think it would be a good idea if you could request elixir and coin donations from clan members as well as troops so that the highest members/main donators can request elixir to train the troops and this would mean the other clan members are contributing towards their own defences for war also.
