The new feature spawns Pokemon at pokestops and shows which ones they are at, so you always know where to go to find specific ones you want. They sometimes still spawn in the wild anyway, so if you aren't near pokestops you can still find some however they will often be notably less rare, e.g. Pidgeys, eevees etc. \n\nGen 2 is finally here, which is great as some of my favourite Pokemon like scizor, typhlosion and feraligatr will finally be catcheable. Got an elekid this morning from my 10k egg (noticed that these have become notably easier to obtain too). One thing that does irritate me is how rare fire types are in the UK, I've only ever caught one Ponyta in the wild, hatched two more and a magmar from eggs and still haven't got ONE charmander since the game came out!\n\nOverall, Pokemon Go is obviously being improved lots and I will continue playing. I recommend it to anyone, whether they are the best competitive battlers or completely new to Pokemon and just want an excuse to go outside. This game is not dead! The only things I suggest adding are trading and breeding as my brother has an Aerodactyl while I have a lapras, and as I prefer Aero while he prefers lapras, it would be great if we could get them. Also if possible they could add an online trading feature, like the GTS in sun and moon, so I could get Kangaskhan, Tauros and farfetch'd and vice versa for others.

This is because winning gym battles does not make you feel that you have achieved much from working on catching all those rare Pok\u00e9mons, instead those who have alot of members on their team will \"win\".\nWinning in pokemon go is a very small accomplishment since it literally takes no skill at all(yes you have to learn how to dodge and stuff) but it takes away the strategic part of the game away unlike the console Pok\u00e9mon games where there are mindgames and prediction and alot of factors such as pokemon abilities and hax moves that will make the game more diverse.\nSince the goal of Pok\u00e9mon goal is to promote exercise, whats the point of that when there are  lesser and lesser people each day playing the game?\nPromoting exercise is already accomplish from hatching eggs and catching Pok\u00e9mon, and now in my opinion Pok\u00e9mon go should now focus on making people actually enjoy playing the game.\n\nThis can be achieved by introducing new mechanics to the game which allows you to make more use of your pokemon such as PvP.\nPvP allows people to believe that they are the very best and will introduce a new competitive sense to the game, it allows more people to spend time on the game and will increase the purpose of catching all those pokemons with high ivs which in turn will promote exercise due to more people will hatch more eggs in hope for a more competitive Pok\u00e9mon. \n\nAdd shiny Pok\u00e9mon\nShiny hunting in the console game has been very popular since catching one will give you so much pride and in a sense will make you feel you are the very best in achieving what so little people have achieved if you have a shiny Pok\u00e9mon \nShiny hunting in console games takes a very long time and is also highly depending on luck\nPok\u00e9mon go could use the shiny feature of Pok\u00e9mon to their advantage to achieve their goals in promoting exercise since it will make people go mindless in hunting for all these  shinies \n\nMy opinion on the current Pok\u00e9mon go roadmap\n\nIf Niantic thinks that slowly adding new generations of pokemon will increase the number of players for the long run they are wrong\n\nBy the time they reach gen3 people will see the pattern of where this is going\nIt is true that some group if people will start to play the game again in hope for getting a mudkip or torchic but after they have their swampert or blaziken they will quit again \nThis is because they will feel that there is no point catching these Pok\u00e9mons if they are going to use them only for boring gym battles.\n\nIn order for more players to get into the game and keep on playing niantic needs to find a way to make the Pok\u00e9mon people have caught more useful otherwise people will think that there is no point in catching all these strong pokemons\n\nIf John Hanke continues to follow his current road map for pokemon go it the game will eventually go downhill due to the reasons stated above\nTo fix this John needs to make the players feel committed in playing the game by introducing more fun features because catching Pok\u00e9mon alone is not the fun aspect of the game but battling with it is.", "rating": "1", "version": "1.21.2", "date": "2017-01-01T02:47:00-07:00", "title": "My opinion on why Pok\u00e9mon go is going downhill"}, {"content": "All other apps work on 4g but this one, it will say no gps when everything is turned on, ive tried everything to get this to work, your game is broke to 4g networks, cause it works just fine on wifi, please assist,ive reset the phone, deleted the app and reinstalled it, ive turned on some different thing to see if it would help, it dont seem to be affecting everyone just some people, and its not my signal or area, as my partner has the 6s+ and she can play it just fine, maybe  a issue with the iphone 7", "rating": "3", "version": "1.21.2", "date": "2017-01-01T02:20:00-07:00", "title": "Poor service with 4g"}, {"content": "my dad plays this game and he recently got an update that lets him have more pokemon i havent been given this update and neither have any of my friends", "rating": "3", "version": "1.21.2", "date": "2017-01-01T02:05:00-07:00", "title": "doesn't give me all the updates"}, {"content": "Well it's a great game but I can't get an account so please help", "rating": "4", "version": "1.21.2", "date": "2017-01-01T01:41:00-07:00", "title": "Can't get an account \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1"}, {"content": "Why can't I open the app since last update.

It is truly an amazing concept, beautifully delivered. We find ourselves almost obsessed with it and playing at every opportunity. At times when our interest has waned, updates have ensured that the game has become more interesting and complex. We particularly enjoy working towards evolving various characters and finding rare Pokemon. The less enjoyable parts of the game are being surrounded by fairly ordinary Pokemon such as Rattatas, Pidgeys and Spearows. Hatching eggs brings an extra dimension to the game and an element of surprise. Playing the game has enabled my son (aged 7) to develop his mental arithmetic skills and has also encouraged him to go out and be more adventurous in order to find new Pokemon.

The game mostly feels empty as there's little opportunity to interact with other players and the main gameplay is very repetitive. The Pok\u00e9mon gym mechanics need a total overhaul as it's too easy for a handful of people to takeover for an indefinite period of time, and the battling system is just awful. Please expand the space one must stand in to interact with the gyms and introduce more creative battling?
