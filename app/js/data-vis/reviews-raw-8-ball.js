I mean, Minecraft has more physics than this game and in Minecraft you can place blocks in the air. Secondly, player response is terrible. I just wanna play pool with my mates without messages every shot saying \"waiting for opponents response do not leave the game.\" It's so annoying! Coming back to the whole thing of physics, I have never played a game of pool irl where a player takes a shot and then the game goes play-by-play in their favour, they win and I wouldn't even take a single shot. I play pool a lot with my family when we go on our holidays to CenterParcs and it's a really fun game, however this game shows pool in a different light. I also had to turn off notifications because I probably would get one every second with people challenging me and getting gifts. Let alone those notifications, the gift ones were repeated by Facebook and I had to disable those too. Don't install if you rage easily and uninstall if you already have it because I don't think a game like this is fun. Hats off to the friend who introduced me to the rest of Miniclip when I was younger, but we should just play real pool instead of buggering about with this excuse for a game", "rating": "1", "version": "3.8.5", "date": "2017-01-26T09:08:00-07:00", "title": "Terrible.
