I personally love this game it doesn't swarm you with ads especially when your actually playing the game and your in a match which is great. The graphics are good and the overall game play is great. I love how you can get free cash from watching ads because it saves you from spending money, I am on 130 cash right now because I just sit watching ads whilst watching tv or something like that and when I finish I have gained over 50 cash. I have my character exactly the way I wanted it and when I finish a season with a little to short stars I just watch those ads and get into it for free.
